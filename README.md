# React-Redux-Example
Learning react and redux
## About
This little example makes use of:
* create-react-app
* react
* redux
* react-redux-router

I started by using the create-react-app tool to setup my basic development environment.
I added redux and redux-router so I could begin to experiment with those tools.
The counter functionality comes from one of the react-redux-router examples, but modified so it works better with the structure I plan to use.
